# scrimba-carousel
On this project we made a carousal using the images provided by the teacher.

Added 3 grey dots that show what slide are we on.

There's an interval that auto slides to the next slideshow every 4 seconds.

Added a button to the bottom right of the slide that enables the interval, 
when toggled will change values to execute different actions.
